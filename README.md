# DeepProtein

#IN PROGRESS:
## Nerual network classifier used to identify protein location (label) in microbes based off of various protein properties (features)
## The goal of this project is two use two different neural network libraries (nerualnet and sci-kitlearn) in two different languages (R and Python) and acheive the same predictive scores
